## Spotify Database Project

This project is an SQL-based relational database designed to mimic the structure and functionalities of a Spotify-like platform. It provides an efficient system to manage and query data related to users, songs, playlists, albums, and subscriptions. The database also includes advanced features like views, stored procedures, and indexing for optimal performance and functionality.


•	Comprehensive ERD Diagram: Visual representation of the database structure.

•	Well-Designed Tables: Includes entities such as Users, Songs, Playlists, Artists, Albums, Payments, Subscriptions, and multiple intersection tables for managing relationships.


•	Stored Procedures: Functions like user authentication, user activity logs, and payment history retrieval enhance usability.

•	Dynamic Views: Predefined views like Most Listened Songs, Liked Songs, and User Country Status provide quick insights.

•	Efficient Indexes: Optimized indexes on frequently queried columns for enhanced database performance.



This project demonstrates best practices in database design and SQL programming, making it a valuable resource for understanding how to build a scalable, real-world application database.



Designed as an educational project, this database simulates a music streaming service’s backend, offering functionality for analyzing user behavior, managing content, and organizing subscription data.
